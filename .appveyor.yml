# This setup tests ICF-related software and workflows. There are two elements
# that have to be kept aligned with ICF's environment:
#
# 1. The input data structure should match the data that ICF receives from
#    acquisition sides.
#
# 2. The software environment should match the environment on ICF's machines,
#    i.e. the versions of: `git`, `git-annex`, `python`, `datalad`, and
#    `datalad-next`.


# This version of Ubuntu is based on debian bullseye
image: Ubuntu2004


environment:
  # Set this to `post-install` to activate the ssh login after the
  # install-steps are executed.
  # Set it to 'pre-tests' to activate ssh login just before the tests are
  # executed.
  # This requires setting `APPVEYOR_SSH_KEY` and `APPVEYOR_SSH_BLOCK`
  ACTIVATE_SSH_LOGIN: no

  # The following variables should be kept in sync with INM-ICF's
